GPR_SEAL stands for Ground Penetrating Radar Simple Easily Accessible Library.

This library contains a bunch of Matlab functions to process 3D Ground Penetrating Radar data. The focus lies on simplicity. The goal is to provide a package that is easy to use for students new to the topic, such that they can be acquainted with 3D-GPR processing without frustration and get good results quickly without needing to write a lot of code.

Please use the script GPR_SEAL_example.m to get an example of the most simple processing flow that contains the absolute minimum of processing steps. Using the functions provided, the example flow can be extended with additional steps.

Each function contains a short description of what it does and how it can be used at the top of the corresponding file. You can print it in the command window of Matlab by typing
help functionname
where functionname is the name of the function in question.
